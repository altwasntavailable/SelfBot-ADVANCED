This is a Discord bot implemented using the Discord.py library. The bot performs various functions and commands in a Discord server.

## Features

- **Uptime**: Displays the bot's uptime.
- **Whois**: Shows information about a user.
- **Restart**: Restarts the bot.
- **Stop**: Stops the bot.
- **Date**: Displays the current date and time in a specific timezone.
- **Ping**: Displays the bot's latency.
- **Set Activity**: Changes the bot's activity.
- **Record**: Records CPU and memory usage for a specified duration.
- **Voice Channel Connection**: Automatically connects to a specified voice channel on startup if the guild ID and channel ID are provided in the `data.json` file.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Discord.py library
- pytz library
- psutil library

## Setup

1. Clone the repository or download the code files.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Create a Discord bot and obtain the bot token from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
4. Set the bot token as an environment variable named `token`. (See instructions below on how to obtain your Discord token)
5. Optionally, modify the code to customize the bot's behavior and commands.
6. If you want the bot to automatically connect to a voice channel on startup:
   - Update the `data.json` file with the desired guild ID and channel ID.
7. If you want to host the bot 24/7 on Replit:
   - Create a new Replit project and import the code files.
   - Create a `.env` file and set the `token` environment variable with your bot token.
   - Create a new file named `keep_alive.py` and copy the code from the provided `keep_alive.py` file into it.
   - Run the `keep_alive.py` file to start a web server that keeps the bot online.
   - Copy the Replit URL of your project and use it to configure a monitor in UptimeRobot to ping the URL and keep the bot running 24/7 for free.

## Usage

- Use the command prefix `!` to trigger the bot commands in the server.
- Refer to the command descriptions in the code or bot help command for details on each command's functionality.
- If you have set up the voice channel connection feature, the bot will automatically join the specified voice channel upon startup.

## How to Obtain Your Discord Token

To obtain your Discord token, you can follow these steps:

1. Open Discord in your web browser and log into your account.
2. Right-click anywhere on the Discord web page and select "Inspect" or "Inspect Element" from the context menu. This will open the browser's Developer Tools.
3. In the Developer Tools window, locate the "Network" tab.
4. Refresh the Discord web page to capture the network requests.
5. Look for a request with the name "science" or "gateway" in the "Name" column. Click on it.
6. In the "Headers" section of the selected request, find the "Authorization" header.
7. The value next to the "Authorization" header is your Discord account token. It will be a long string of characters.

Remember to keep your Discord token private and secure. Do not share it with anyone, as it provides full access to your Discord account.
